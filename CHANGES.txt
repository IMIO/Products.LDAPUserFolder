Change log for Products.LDAPUserFolder
======================================

3.0 (unreleased)
----------------
- pin several packages to avoid pulling in Zope version 4
- sanitized buildout test script generation to always use the 
  ``exportimport`` extra and always test the `GenericSetup` 
  export/import support
- Add a simple ``tox`` configuration file to support automated testing
  on all supported Python versions
- Add a ``test_require`` and ``test_suite`` argument in ``setup.py``
  to enable testing using just ``setup.py test``
- Removed the LDAPUserSatellite code due to severe bit-rot. Please use
  the PluggableAuthService package in conjunction with LDAPMultiPlugins
  to gain the same functionality.
- Removed the CMF tools, please use the package ``Products.CMFLDAP``
  (see http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.CMFLDAP/1.0) instead.
- moved change log entries for version 2.18 and older from CHANGES.txt
  to HISTORY.txt
- reformat HISTORY.txt and make it ReST-compliant
- clean up formatting of CHANGES.txt


2.23 (2012-04-23)
-----------------
- Add ``setuptools-git`` to ``setup_requires`` to prevent missing 
  files in the egg release - versions 2.22 and 2.21 will not build
  due to a missing ``VERSION.txt``.


2.22 (2012-04-23)
-----------------
- factored some tests into separate modules to increase 
  maintainability
- Moved all documentary text files into the egg root


2.21 (2012-04-21)
-----------------
- Make sure to raise OverflowError if no users can be found 
  when calling ``getUserNames``
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/972408)
- switch to using the standalone ``dataflake.fakeldap`` package 
  for unit tests


2.20 (2011-05-04)
-----------------
- Fix for CVE-2010-2944
  (http://secunia.com/advisories/cve_reference/CVE-2010-2944/),
  which was never reported upstream by the Debian people, who
  found the problem 8 months ago (see
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=593466).
  Thanks guys.


2.19 (2011-01-10)
-----------------
- Add attribute name to the negative_cache_key so requests 
  for same value but different attribute do not poison the 
  cache.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/695821)
- The changed base classes in Zope 2.13 did not define 
  isPrincipiaFolderish, so the user folder would no longer show
  up in the left hand navigation pane in the ZMI.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/693315)
- Fixed a faulty check for unicode so user expiration will not
  fail if a unicode value is passed in. Changed all checks for
  string and unicode to use basestring.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/700071)
- Fixed an export/import test error so all tests run again.
- The Manager DN Password value on the ``Configure`` tab in the 
  ZMI showed up in clear text when viewing the HTML source for 
  the rendered page.
